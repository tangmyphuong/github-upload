    "# DIGI405-19S2 Lab Exercise 1: Working with corpus evidence\n",
    "## Preparing for this lab exercise\n",
    "This task will get you to practice concordancing a word, finding patterns within the concordance, and writing about these patterns using corpus evidence. These are crucial skills in corpus analysis. You will be required to use these skills in your corpus analysis essay and other assessments. \n",
    "* The lectures and labs in weeks two and three are relevant in preparing for this task. Chapter 4 in the textbook for the course covers concordance analysis in detail. On pages 92-93 in the textbook there is a step-by-step guide to concordance analysis.\n",
    "* Although we are working with a notebook in a web browser, you are still expected to proof your answers for grammar and spelling errors. \n",
    "* Download the Clinton-Trump Corpus:  \n",

    "  The Clinton-Trump Corpus consists of speeches by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at events during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. The speeches for each speaker are stored in two separate directories. The page where you download the corpus also includes notes on settings to work with the corpus files in AntConc (i.e. how to enable the \"Hide Tags\" feature).\n",
    "* You can include images (e.g. a screenshot of relevant concordance results from AntConc), but these must be appropriately captioned.\n",
    "* Once you have completed this lab exercise you should submit your notebook on Learn.\n",
