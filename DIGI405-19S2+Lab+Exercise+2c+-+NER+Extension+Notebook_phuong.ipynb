    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This task will get you to train a named entity recognition (NER) model using a tiny data-set and to think through some of the issues in detecting named entities. The task code is based on the example provided on the Spacy website here: https://spacy.io/usage/training#example-new-entity-type\n",
    "\n",
    "Our named entity recogniser will attempt to detect the names of iwi. Iwi are a fundamental social grouping in Māori society, both before and after British colonisation. Iwi are introduced in detail here: https://teara.govt.nz/en/tribal-organisation/page-1. Please read through this page and the linked pages on Māori tribal organisation: https://teara.govt.nz/en/tribal-organisation, including the page on iwi names and history. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iwi affiliations are a key aspect of the social identity of many Māori. For example, in formal occasions or when meeting for the first time, it is common for Māori (and people of other ancestry in New Zealand) to introduce themselves with reference to their iwi and their genealogy. See discussion here: https://www.otago.ac.nz/maori/world/tikanga/whakapapa/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is information on the geographic regions associated with each iwi on this page: http://www.tkm.govt.nz/map/\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also find discussion of iwi and issues around naming and classification on the Statistics New Zealand page here: http://archive.stats.govt.nz/methods/classifications-and-standards/classification-related-stats-standards/iwi.aspx. This page also links to an Excel spreadsheet of iwi names.\n",

If our data set for training is not large and accurate, we can't build the model that have ability to detect language better. Besides, we also need to have a proper knowledge about the topic(for example, in this case, we need to have general knowlege about statistical classification of iwi name. From that, we can collect the correct training dataset."
